\section{Literature}

We found an article \cite{womansarticle} were the author worked on a subset of our dataset and she obtained an accuracy of 78\%. She obtained such result with just three dense layers:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
x = vgg_model.output
x = Flatten()(x) # Flatten dimensions to for use in FC layers
x = Dense(512, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dropout(0.5)(x) # Dropout layer to reduce overfitting
x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dense(8, activation='softmax')(x) # Softmax for multiclass
transfer_model = Model(inputs=vgg_model.input, outputs=x)	
\end{lstlisting}

while reaching almost 100\% accuracy on the training set, this might be due to \emph{overfit} over the data.
